Visibility and Inheritance

By default, all methods in Ruby are public
3 kinds of methods:
    - public
    - protected
    - private

Different from Java, C++

public: methods that can be called within the class, subclasses, and instances without restriction
protected: methods that can ONLY be called within the class and subclasses
    - either EXPLICITLY or IMPLICITLY
    - can't be called directly
private: methods that can ONLY be called within the class and subclasses IMPLICITLY

Inheritance
A class can INHERIT methods from parent classes. When a class inherits from a parent class, it is called the child class or subclass.
