installed bcrypt and hirb through Gemfile

Gems
- bits of code that you can use on project to enhance functionality
- little libraries can include in project to cut down code needed to write
- gems built into ruby, so can work for Rails project, most gems designed with Rails in mind
- gems have ups and downs

Pros
- complex task easier
- less code, more time to focus on project
- best are easy to use

Cons
- made by community, so hard to ensure quality. some are great, some will take longer to integrate than just building from scratch
- gems may also have bugs devs are unaware of
- need whole gem installed, even if just need one piece of functionality, can lower performance
- not as easy to understand what's going on behind scene


Installing gem is straightforward. Gemfile is in root directory of rails project

gem 'gem_name', '>= version_num'

In terminal, need to do bundle install inside project


hirb
    - makes terminal do queries and look at data 1000x better. puts query results into table so can see data much more effectively when in Rails console.
    - in Rails console, type Hirb.enable
    - resize window/table, by Hirb.disable, then .enable again

bcrypt
simple_form 
    - easier forms, taps into next gem for styling
bootstrap-sass
    - CSS library at end of CSS section, have gem for Rails. Can use bootstrap throughout project without having to use a cdn
carrierwave
    - makes easy to upload files, images, pdf docs and anything you can think of
capybara and rspec
    - Helps test our apps to ensure everything is working the way it should

Thousands of great gems out there.
