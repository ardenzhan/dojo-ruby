FOLDER STRUCTURE
app folder most important, holds mvc folders and assests (images, js, stylesheets)

config folder
    - config files, tests, productions
    - routes.rb, routes files

db folder
    - db info
    - Gemfile
        - packages of app

- if deploying, may want to switch
    - Heroku uses PostgreSQL
